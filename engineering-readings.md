# Engineering Readings

## What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

Based on my skills, projects, and experience, I believe that the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can is my unique combination of engineering background and full-stack web development expertise. This diverse skill set enables me to approach problems in a unique way and come up with creative solutions that others may not think of. Additionally, my passion for self-learning and my ability to adapt to new technologies and challenges allow me to continually improve and stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving field of web development.

## What are the things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

To become a better problem solver in programming, it is important to break the problem into sub-problems and practice the skill. Instead of jumping straight into coding, it is recommended to read and fully understand the problem, solve it manually, and optimize the steps before writing code. Don't be afraid to fail, focus on the end goal, and try multiple solutions until success.

A simple set of steps:

 1. Read the problem completely twice (understand the problem).
 2. divide the problem into sub-problems
 3. Solve the problem manually with 3 sets of sample data.
 4. Optimize the manual steps.
 5. Write the manual steps as comments or pseudo-code.
 6. Replace the comments or pseudo-code with real code.
 7. deal with being stuck by debugging, reassessing
Optimize the real code.
