## Reading Questions

### `In the context of the reading “Pain and Suffering,” describe the main challenges faced by beginners when learning Python and suggest at least two strategies for overcoming these obstacles.`

the main challenges is stress and frustration, emotionally,pushed emotionally, and mentally.

the two strategies for overcoming these obstacles are:

- for me I try to look where I will be when I finish the course and what I can be able to to do.
- Ask questions
- Break down complex concepts into smaller.

### `After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.`

**Time complexity** refers to the amount of time that an algorithm takes to run as a function of the input size.

**space complexity** refers to the amount of memory that an algorithm requires to run as a function of the input size.

### `Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.`

Immutable data types are those whose values cannot be changed after they are created. On the other hand, mutable data types are those whose values can be changed after they are created.

## Things I want to know more about

- I want to know more about the Big O notation and how to determine the Complicity of complex algorithm.
